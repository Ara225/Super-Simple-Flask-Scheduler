# Super Simple Flask Schedular 

## What?
Basically, it's supposed to be the simplest and easiest to use/understand useful Python GUI web based schedular.

## Why? 
Mainly a personal keep-busy sort of project. Loosely designed to fill a gap in that there aren't any complete simple web 
schedulers (that I could find).

## Is it useful? 
Not right now. I hope it may be in the future.

## TODO
    * Refactor code
    * Document code
    * Implement optional persistent job storage 
    * Implement Python job functionality
    * Improve GUI of jobs and jobs result screen 
    * Implement basic remote job functionality
    * Implement actual scheduling function rather than just running everything now
    * Implement authentication 
    * Write some tests
    * Eliminate use of global vars

## Contributions/Thoughts
Very welcome
