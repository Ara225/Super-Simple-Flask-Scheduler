# Super Simple Flask Schedular 

## What?
Basically, it's supposed to be the simplest and easiest to use/understand useful Python GUI web based schedular.

## Why? 
Mainly a personal keep-busy sort of project. Loosely designed to fill a gap in that there aren't any complete simple web 
schedulers (that I could find).

## TODO
* Implement optional persistent job storage 
* Implement Python job functionality
* Improve GUI of jobs and jobs result screen 
* Implement basic remote job functionality
* Implement actual scheduling function rather than just running everything now
* Implement authentication 
* Write some tests
* Eliminate use of global vars

## Contributions/Thoughts
Very welcome
