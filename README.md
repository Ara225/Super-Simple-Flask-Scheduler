# Super Simple Flask Schedular 

## What?
Basically, it's supposed to be a simple and easy to use/understand useful Python GUI web based schedular.

## Why? 
Mainly a personal keep-busy sort of project. Loosely designed to fill a gap in that there aren't any 
complete simple web schedulers (that I could find). It's not particularly good though so.

## TODO
* Implement optional persistent job storage 
* Implement Python job functionality
* Improve GUI of jobs and jobs result screen 
* Implement basic remote job functionality
* Implement authentication 
* Write some tests
* Eliminate use of global vars
* Improve the cleanup job
